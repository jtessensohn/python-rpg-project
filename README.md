# Python RPG
This short-term RPG features four classes, four enemy types and boss that scale with the player. Basic exp and level up system as well as a gold system. Players find themselves choosing between a warrior, priest, mage, or rogue, exploring outside the town defeating enemies to earn exp to get stronger in an attempt to defeat a boss enemy, and spending gold at the tavern to recuperate between battles. It's currently ran in-terminal.

## Motivation
![alt text](https://i.redd.it/qfeftum6i0l11.jpg)
This project initially began as an in-class exercise to practice and explore python concepts. At the end of the exercise we were assigned an open ended project with the option to continue the RPG. RPGs being something I'm comfortable with and having already written through the game enough to where I felt like it was more min than exercise, I opted to continue making features for it for the assigned project.
